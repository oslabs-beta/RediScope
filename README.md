# RediScope

RediScope is a free, open-source web application that intuitively and elegantly displays relevant Redis cache performance metrics that are most important to developers: memory, cache/hit ratio, evicted keys, and those related to latency and throughput.

Redis (**RE**mote **DI**ctionary **S**tore) is an in-memory key-value store, often used for caching, or temporary storage. Maintaining the health of a Redis cache is important for maximizing one of Redisâ€™ primary benefits, increasing website speed. Visualizing relevant performance metrics helps developers quickly assess Redis cache health, helping them troubleshoot and solve cache performance issues. Our team found there were few fully free resources available for developers to easily view raw performance metrics in an easy-to-use way. We were motivated to provide this essential service, focusing on those metrics that matter most to cache performance speed.

**Stack:** Redis, React, React Router, TypeScript, Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL, Bcrypt, Chart.js, Yup, Formik, Axios, AWS(EC2, ElasticBeanStalk), Docker, Morgan and more.
